CIS 1051 Final Project: The Casino Heist- A Virtual Novel

I have always been very interested in escape rooms so for my final project I wanted to simulate that in a cirtual novel.
Created entirely in Renpy, this is my submission for my final project in my CIS 1051 Python class.
Below is a voiceover of my project:

Besides the differences in syntax, Renpy was fairly easy to use with my knowledge of Python.
I wish that I was able to allow for the user to customize their character, but I was unable to do so. 
I am most proud of the "combination lock" mini-game that I had implemented.
I had followed along a tutorial on YouTube and this allowed me to learn even more about Renpy and its different functions

Below is the tutorial I utilized for the mentioned mini-game:

To create my characters, I had utilized the free character creator linked below:

For my backgrounds, I searched multiple online forumes for free-to-use backgrounds with DeviantArt beingmy main source of license-free images:
