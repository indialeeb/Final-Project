# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The Great Casino Heist (or something along those lines)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I want my project to be a visual novel more or less like an escape room where there's a clear objective and several puzzles. As of now I want to make it related to some sort of heist.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The program is going to be something more or less like an escape room in the format of a visual novel. The user will be able to make a variety of different choices in the beginning, including their disguise, that will ultimately contribute to how sucessful they are in the heist. There will be a variety of puzzles that, when done correctly, will lead the user closer to completing the heist.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I am not planning on combining this final project with another course's final project.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I will be working by myself.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what, I want to create a series of puzzles and corresponding outcomes depending on the user's success.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would include more complex puzzles and a richer sotryline along with it.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would include several complex and intricate puzzles that create a deeper and more complex plot for the visual novel. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Next, I will looking at different visuals and come up with more details on what kind of heist this visual novel will center around. I will then familiarize myself with ren'py and how I can use the software to best reach my goal.
